                      4CommunityCare (4CC) is a committed group of volunteers providing food and assistance to
local seniors and families in the neighborhoods of Poway Unified School District. We partner
with local nonprofits and churches to build strong community relationships that shape the way
we serve.
<br>
<br>
4CommunityCare has a number of like-minded volunteers that previously worked together many
years with another agency that disbanded in August 2020, called Friends &amp; Family Community
Connection (FFCC).

                    <p class="aboutText1">
                      Without a pause, the work to help families with food resources (which
                      intensified due to the pandemic), has gone forward.  After developing relationships with families,
                      we often learn other ways we can provide assistance.  Gift cards, clothing and other household
                      items are passed directly to local families who struggle with daily expenses.
